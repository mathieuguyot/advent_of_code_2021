My advent of code 2021 solutions written in Haskell !
I've choose this language to practice a bit my function programming skills.
Problems solving code pieces I provide are not modified after resolution, and I have not that much time this december, so the code will be a bit messy on some parts, but hopefully main parts will be clean !
